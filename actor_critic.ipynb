    "The $G - V$ term in our $L_{actor}$ formulation is called the [Advantage](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#advantage-functions), which indicates how much better an action is given a particular state over a random action selected according to the policy $\\pi$ for that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's possible to exclude a baseline, this may result in high variance during training. And the nice thing about choosing the critic $V$ as a baseline is that it trained to be as close as possible to $G$, leading to a lower variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, without the Critic, the algorithm would try to increase probabilities for actions taken on a particular state based on expected return, which may not make much of a difference if the relative probabilities between actions remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose that two actions for a given state would yield the same expected return. Without the Critic, the algorithm would try to raise the probability of these actions based on the objective $J$. With the Critic, it may turn out that there's no Advantage ($G - V = 0$), and thus no benefit gained in increasing the actions' probabilities and the algorithm would set the gradients to zero.\n",
